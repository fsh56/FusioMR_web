\usage{
fusiomr(
  b_exp,
  se_exp,
  b_out,
  se_out,
  CHP = FALSE,
  p_value_threshold = 0.001,
  niter = 20000,
  burnin_prop = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{b_exp}{Numeric matrix or vector of effect estimates for instrumental variables
on exposure. Must have exactly 1 column and same number of rows as other inputs.}

\item{se_exp}{Numeric matrix or vector of standard errors for IV-exposure effect
estimates. Must have exactly 1 column, same dimensions as b_exp, and all positive values.}

\item{b_out}{Numeric matrix or vector of effect estimates for instrumental variables
on outcome(s). Must have 1 column (single outcome) or 2 columns (multiple outcomes),
with same number of rows as b_exp.}

\item{se_out}{Numeric matrix or vector of standard errors for IV-outcome effect
estimates. Must have same dimensions as b_out and all positive values.}

\item{CHP}{Logical indicating whether to include horizontal pleiotropy correction
(default: FALSE).}

\item{p_value_threshold}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 for IV selection threshold
(default: 1e-3). Used to filter instruments based on IV-exposure association strength.}

\item{niter}{Positive integer specifying number of Gibbs sampling iterations
(default: 20000).}

\item{burnin_prop}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying proportion of iterations
  to discard as burn-in (default: 0.5).

\itemize{
  \item Model 1: Single Exposure Single Outcome (No Horizontal Pleiotropy)
  \item Model 2: Single Exposure Single Outcome (With Horizontal Pleiotropy)
  \item Model 3: Single Exposure Multiple Outcomes (No Horizontal Pleiotropy)
  \item Model 4: Single Exposure Multiple Outcomes (With Horizontal Pleiotropy)
}}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{est}{Numeric vector of posterior mean(s) of causal effect. Single value for
    single outcome, vector of length 2 for multiple outcomes.}
  \item{se}{Numeric vector of posterior standard error(s) of causal effect. Single value
    for single outcome, vector of length 2 for multiple outcomes.}
  \item{pval}{Numeric vector of p-value(s) for testing null hypothesis of no causal effect.
    Single value for single outcome, vector of length 2 for multiple outcomes.}
}
}
\description{
A Flexible, Unified and verSatile Mendelian Randomization framework.
Supports both single and multiple outcome analyses with optional horizontal pleiotropy.
